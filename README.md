## Intro ##

This repository contains code written by [Jade Piramide](https://www.github.com/Jiramide) in his CS701
course in Under The Gui Academy. (Dated 2019)

The programming language used in the course is Java, albeit I may add
code using other languages for comparison.

All Java code will follow Google's [Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
unless specified in the `.editorconfig` file located in the file tree.
